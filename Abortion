Neelam stared at the blinking cursor on her LinkedIn post, a knot of tension tightening in her stomach. Three days had passed since the Supreme Court's decision on Roe v. Wade, and the anger simmered beneath the surface. Finally, she typed, her fingers flying across the keyboard. "My body, my choice. I can't but disagree with the decision. Anyone who wants a place to stay to get an abortion done and recover, DM me."
As a Senior VP in a tech company, Neelam wielded influence. Her voice, amplified by thousands of followers across social media, had the power to spark a movement. But the vulnerability of putting her stance out there was raw and real.
The next morning, as she entered the office, she spotted Jane, a staunch conservative colleague, across the hallway. A premonition of a tense day washed over Neelam. Jane offered a curt nod, her disapproval hanging heavy in the air. Thankfully, Vinita, a colleague with similar views, broke the tension with a warm smile and a supportive, "Loved your post today, Neelam."
Likes and messages of solidarity trickled in, a wave of encouragement. But life had a way of moving on. Soon, Neelam was caught in the familiar vortex of work deadlines and the dreaded phone calls from her mother back in India.
"Get married soon. You're already past your prime!" the refrain went, a constant reminder of the societal pressure to settle down. This time, however, Neelam surprisingly agreed to a blind date set up by her mother – Nirav, a seemingly compatible match based on their horoscopes.
Their first date flowed easily. They delved into shared interests – movies, food, work – finding common ground. A spark ignited, and Neelam found herself looking forward to their frequent outings. One evening, the conversation took an unexpected turn.
"Look at that adorable toddler," Nirav remarked, pointing to a nearby table. "I love kids. Probably at least three, someday."
Neelam braced herself. Nirav continued, his voice laced with a subtle disappointment, "Children are a gift. Yet, there are so many couples struggling to conceive, while others…" he trailed off.
Neelam understood his unspoken implication - the current abortion debate. "Women should have control over their bodies," she stated firmly.
"Pro-choice, are you?" Nirav inquired.
They discussed Roe v. Wade, the regressive shift in the US, and India's recent legalization of abortion. A clash of perspectives emerged. "Laws may change," Nirav argued, "but morals transcend them. It's a personal choice rooted in ethics."
Neelam countered, "Morality is subjective. Laws provide a framework for a functioning society."
Their conversation reached an impasse. Neelam's mind drifted back to a time capsule locked away in her past – Ned, her first love from Berkeley, and the life-altering decision that forever changed their world.
A missed period, a doctor's confirmation, and a swirl of emotions – fear, uncertainty, a yearning for her dreams. The doctor had showed her the baby in her womb. A tiny creature., just a mere outline of a human, growing within her womb. Starting off as a single-celled zygote, the cells rapidly and continuously had grown in the three months. The gynecologist showed her the neural tube which will become the brain and spine. She saw two pairs of ten tiny buds – the genesis of fingers and toes. Three distinct parts were visible in the creature within her womb, all less than one sixth of an inch – which she doc explained as future head, trunk, and legs.
Faced with an unplanned pregnancy, the decision for an abortion was agonizing but ultimately clear. Ned, however, reacted with outrage. He saw it as a betrayal, the snuffing out of a potential life. Their relationship fractured, leaving a gaping wound in Neelam's heart.
Nirav's mention of a "cosmic law" sparked a fresh wave of guilt, a burden she'd carried for a decade. The memory of her mother's impassioned plea against abortion echoed in her mind.
The last conversation on the topic with her mother now seemed to add fuel to the fire. A few months ago, when India had had just passed the abortion laws, her mother had told her on a phone call, “Bhrūṇahatyā  is one of the worst sins one can commit. There is no repentance for this crime. And, Neelam, if ever you are in that situation, irrespective of the circumstances you are in or any birth defects with the baby, promise me you will deliver the baby.”
Tears welled up as she excused herself from dinner. Back in her apartment, Netflix recommended "Reversing Roe." Overwhelmed, she switched it off, seeking solace in a bottle of vodka. But the familiar burn couldn't extinguish the embers of a long-dormant emotional fire, of guilt and shame.
